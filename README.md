# Summary:
Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer death worldwide. Breast cancer that forms in the cells of the breasts. It can occur in women and rarely in men. The main symptoms of breast cancer include a lump in the breast, bloody discharge from the nipple, and changes in the shape or texture of the nipple or breast. It can be controlled if we detect it in the early stage and can save lives. It's treatment depends on the stage of cancer and can implement multiple prevention methods such as chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery.
Hence, detection is the first step in saving the life of breast cancer patients. So, here I am using CNN algorithms to detect whether the tissue is malignant or benign.
